Sensors Data: https://www.sensorsdata.cn/, customer acquisition, gain profit
similar to Google analytics, analyzing site's traffic, and understand user behaviors

Goal:
1. Clean dirty log data and transform it for analytics
2. EDA: user activity levels for different events, user interaction with web components
3. Metric: conversion rate of users, identify key factors that bottleneck the conversion rate
4. Build ML models to predict user behaviours (features), e.g. signup, churn
5. Discover interesting insights, improve signup rate
6. Propose hypothesis for company to set up experiments for testing

Raw Data:
id, web browser, pc/mobile, refer url (campaign), utm 5 parameters (campaign), session_page,
ip, first_visit, 
utm: url parameter, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameters

generate features (e.g. referral), feature combination (top 5 referals-> cover 80% info)

Data Process:
Different event types:
    1. page visit:
    2. page leave:
    3. button click:
    4. submit: formSubmit, ...
       可做response variable, boost probability of cost label
Transform from event based log -> user based data (features) (FEATURE ENGINEERING)
    1. use Boolean/Count to indicate whether or how many times user has certain event
    2. event related attributes (time, intervals, transformation) as seperate features
    3. treat chinese characters as a new level or NLP or library
  
Data Exploration: 
User activity by day of week:
  weekday vs weekend pattern
  dataset span
  worktime (8am to 5pm) more easy to register
Funnel Analysis:
  drop from page view (could use A/B test verify)
    page not interest?
    improve page quality
  sharp drop (check conversion rate drop at which step)
Compare user behavior in/out China
    IP address to identify
UTM analysis (Source, Medium, Value, Campaign, Content)
    tracking, marketing campaign
    attract/target specific group of people
    
Data Transformation:
Feature processing:
    collapse categorical
    log transformation for too wide numerica features: page stay time
    missing value: <80%, mean/median
Feature selection:
    correlation, multicollinearity (if use Regression, need regularization), no need for tree-based
    tree-based, feature importance plot

Model Fitting: 
    many options
    Logistic Regrrssion: auc, roc, feature importance -> draw insight
    ...
    
Understand model output:
    Negative Coefficient
    Positive Coefficient
    Insignificant Coefficient

What can the business learn?
Funnel Analysis
Product promotion or strategic campaign have no significant impact (Campaign Effectiveness)
    e.g.: T test on: refer from A (conversion rate) vs refer from B (conversion rate)
Suggestion on sign up rate improvement:
    model insight 
    hypothesis: coefficient ~ response
    need company to test on the hypothesis
