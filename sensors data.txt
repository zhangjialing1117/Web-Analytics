Sensors Data: https://www.sensorsdata.cn/, customer acquisition, gain profit
similar to Google analytics, analyzing site's traffic, and understand user behaviors

Goal:
1. Clean dirty log data and transform it for analytics
2. EDA: user activity levels for different events, user interaction with web components
3. Metric: conversion rate of users, identify key factors that bottleneck the conversion rate
4. Build ML models to predict user behaviours (features), e.g. signup, churn
5. Discover interesting insights, improve signup rate
6. Propose hypothesis for company to set up experiments for testing

Raw Data:
id, web browser, pc/mobile, refer url (campaign), utm 5 parameters (campaign), session_page,
ip, first_visit, 
utm: url parameter, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameters

generate features (e.g. referral), feature combination (top 5 referals-> cover 80% info)

Data Process:
Different event types:
    1. page visit:
    2. page leave:
    3. button click:
    4. submit: formSubmit, ...
       可做response variable, boost probability of cost label
Transform from event based log -> user based data (features) (FEATURE ENGINEERING)
    1. use Boolean/Count to indicate whether or how many times user has certain event
    2. event related attributes (time, intervals, transformation) as seperate features
  
Data Exploration: 
User activity by day of week:
  weekday vs weekend
  dataset span
  worktime (8am to 5pm)
Funnel Analysis:
  drop from page view
  sharp drop
