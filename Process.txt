1. Metric Design: 
Evaluate new product -> know & familiar with the product first (app, product) e.g. 脸书

2. The volume of users increased (traffic), but the total number of conversions has decrease
(intuition, understand of the product)
      1). Investage the user journey - often landing on particular pages, and then failing to convert
            high bounce rate -> redesign the page
            prevent bouncing off -> include internal links (attract user)
      2). Check conversion funnel to identify the problem
            conversion funnel: (could be including steps) 
            start from front page, put stuff in cart, read recommendation items, read customer reviews, find best sellers, etc. see step percentage and drops
            redesigning the goal flow -> less fields on a submission form/ fewer steps altogether
      3). Utilize your most popular pages as a medium to increase conversions
       
Conversion Rate: the percentage of users who take a desired action. archetypical example: the percentage of website visitors who buy something on the site. Conversions don't have to be sales but can be any key performance indicator (KPI) that matters for your business.
